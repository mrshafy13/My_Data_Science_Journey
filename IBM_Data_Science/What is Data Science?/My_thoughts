This is a very nice course to begin your journey, where you will learn what a data scientist do, why they do and how they do. This course is all about others stories, what they use which background they're from.
My takes from this course is your background has little impact on your career as a data scientist. People whom were interviewed throughout the course most of them had their major as other than Computer Science, such as:
1. Statistics
2. Mechanical Engineering
and many more.
The field is diverse, yet it needs more data scientist, so be focused and start your journey and always take notes.

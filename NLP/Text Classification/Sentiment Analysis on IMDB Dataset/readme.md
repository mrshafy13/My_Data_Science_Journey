## Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. I have used three models for this task: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

## Models
1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for binary classification.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**: A non-linear model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

## Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Below is a summary of the results:

| Model                    | Accuracy | 
|--------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression      | 89% | 
| Decision Tree Classifier | 76% | 
| Random Forest Classifier | 85% |
